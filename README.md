### \[Support Local / Remote Database]\[docs-feat-database]

MarkAI supports the use of both server-side and local databases. Depending on your needs, you can choose the appropriate deployment solution:

- **Local database**: suitable for users who want more control over their data and privacy protection. MarkAI uses CRDT (Conflict-Free Replicated Data Type) technology to achieve multi-device synchronization. This is an experimental feature aimed at providing a seamless data synchronization experience.
- **Server-side database**: suitable for users who want a more convenient user experience. MarkAI supports PostgreSQL as a server-side database.

Regardless of which database you choose, MarkAI can provide you with an excellent user experience.

![Progressive Web App](./public/images/markai.png)

### \[Progressive Web App (PWA)]\[docs-feat-pwa]

We deeply understand the importance of providing a seamless experience for users in today's multi-device environment.
Therefore, we have adopted Progressive Web Application ([PWA](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/9658361)) technology,
a modern web technology that elevates web applications to an experience close to that of native apps.

Through PWA, MarkAI can offer a highly optimized user experience on both desktop and mobile devices while maintaining its lightweight and high-performance characteristics.
Visually and in terms of feel, we have also meticulously designed the interface to ensure it is indistinguishable from native apps,
providing smooth animations, responsive layouts, and adapting to different device screen resolutions.

> \[!NOTE]
>
> If you are unfamiliar with the installation process of PWA, you can add MarkAI as your desktop application (also applicable to mobile devices) by following these steps:

> - Launch the Chrome or Edge browser on your computer.
> - Visit the MarkAI webpage.
> - In the upper right corner of the address bar, click on the <kbd>Install</kbd> icon.
> - Follow the instructions on the screen to complete the PWA Installation.

### \[Mobile Device Adaptation]\[docs-feat-mobile]

We have carried out a series of optimization designs for mobile devices to enhance the user's mobile experience. Currently, we are iterating on the mobile user experience to achieve smoother and more intuitive interactions. If you have any suggestions or ideas, we welcome you to provide feedback through GitHub Issues or Pull Requests.

![Custom Themes](./public/images/theme_light.webp)

### \[Custom Themes]\[docs-feat-theme]

As a design-engineering-oriented application, MarkAI places great emphasis on users' personalized experiences,
hence introducing flexible and diverse theme modes, including a light mode for daytime and a dark mode for nighttime.
Beyond switching theme modes, a range of color customization options allow users to adjust the application's theme colors according to their preferences.
Whether it's a desire for a sober dark blue, a lively peach pink, or a professional gray-white, users can find their style of color choices in MarkAI.

> \[!TIP]
>
> The default configuration can intelligently recognize the user's system color mode and automatically switch themes to ensure a consistent visual experience with the operating system.
> For users who like to manually control details, MarkAI also offers intuitive setting options and a choice between chat bubble mode and document mode for conversation scenarios.
